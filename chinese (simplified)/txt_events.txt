#event_trout_w2
贸易路线警告: 货物丢失!

#event_trout_w2_1
Our trade route with [x] operated by [y] is missing [p2] of cargo to be operated properly. The trade route will close soon unless we fix this issue quickly.

#event_trout_w2_2
The cargo service is what allows to carry the goods continuously along a trade route and maintain a constant transfer of resources. Each route, depending on the distance and volume of the traded goods, requires a certain amount of cargo.  

#event_trout_w2_3
However, this operator no longer produces enough of the requried cargo service to properly operate this trade route: To fix this issue, it needs to increase its available service or we need to switch to a new different operator that can provide the required cargo ([p3]).

Our trade route with [x] closed because its operator [y] was unable to provide the required cargo ([p3]) to maintain it (was missing [p2]).

#event_trout_b2_2
The cargo service is what allows to carry the goods continuously along a trade route and maintain a constant transfer of resources. Each route, depending on the distance and volume of the traded goods, requires a certain amount of cargo.  

#event_trout_b2_3
However, this operator no longer produces enough of the requried cargo service to properly operate this trade route: To fix this issue, it needs to increase its available service or we need to switch to a new different operator that can provide the required cargo ([p3]).

#event_projfail_1
Our project of '[x]' with [p2]% chances of success has been completed, but unfortunately it failed to meet its expectations and we have not earned its expected rewards. I'm afraid we have to start again from scratch and hope for better results...

#event_projfail_2
A project may fail if its difficulty is higher than the average intelligence of the researchers assigned to it. We should try to assign better researchers to increase our chaces of success next time!

#event_herd_1
The scouts of the tribe have spotted a moving heard of around [p1] [p2] near our settlement of [x],in a territory of [y].

[P3]逃脱了我们'[x]'的监视!

#event_form_animesc_1
[p2] [p3] have escaped from the surveillance of our formation '[x]' that was guarding them, and are now lost.

#event_form_animesc_2
Animals may escape if they are too numerous relative to their keepers or simply kept for too long in a formation's inventory. To make sure this doesn't happen again, maybe we should consider parking them in proper paddocks or carrying smaller numbers so they are less likely to escape the supervision of their assigned keepers.

#event_rcvidea
我们从[x]那里得到了一个新想法!

#event_rcvidea_1
Good news: the people of [x] have shown us their knowledge of [p1] and explained to us the rudiments of what it is and how it works.

爱唠叨的妻子

#ev_nagwif_1
One porco of the village of [x], exasperated by the constant naggings of his Sow, decided to go on a lonely retreat in the wilderness to hunt and thus he disapeared for several days. 

#ev_nagwif_2
Many feared he would never return. But on the 5th day he came back, carrying with him the spoils of what had turned out to be a greatly successful hunt. He was cheered by the whole tribe. His wife however was not pleased and left with her piglets to live at her mother's tribe on the other side of valley.

#ev_regwolf_1

#ev_asylm
寻求庇护者[x]

#ev_asylm_1
A group of nomads arrived in our territory of [x]. They told their story of how they were chased away of their lands by another neighboring tribe after a conflict between them.

#ev_asylm_2
Attacked during one night, they lost most of their people and fled their homeland, but not before one of their best warriors managed to kill the chief of the enemy tribe. Since then, his son has vowed to hunt them down for revenge no matter where they go, and they have been on the run for many weeks. 

#ev_asylm_3
Their pursuers are not far behind, and your tribe is now their only hope. They beg for asylum and safety, offering to pledge their loyalty to our people if we accept to protect them. If we do, we will have to fight their pursuers! 

#ev_asylm_c1

#ev_knowtrav
知识渊博的旅行者

#ev_knowtrav_1
One day, an old pig arrived in our village of [x], his feet weary from the many travels he had made. He was a lonely hermit, living and travelling alone for many years now. 

#ev_knowtrav_2
He told the tale of the ancient people he belonged to, who perished a long time ago from a mysterious desease that he was the only one to miraculously recover from, fleeing away from his land. He also told stories of how his people used to live: incredible stories about things they did that noone here had ever though off. There was much to learn from his teachings as he seemed to come from a more refined a mysterious people. 

#ev_knowtrav_3
But the wonder and influence he gained amongst the tribe started to upset its more dominant members who felt their position threatened... What should we do about it ?

#ev_knowtrav_c1
Listen to what this traveler has to teach even if it upsets them.

#ev_knowtrav_c2
Ban the oldpig of the village for his lies.

#ev_heirprop

#ev_heirprop_1
[x] is now inactive and his position is up for succession. He designated you as his heir, and you can therefore immediately take his place within the Nation.

#ev_heirprop_2
If you agree, your positions will be immediately swapped: you will inherit his rank and subordinates while he inherits yours, becoming your own subordinate. Depending on your new title's priviledges, you might then be able to remove him entirely from the Nation, dismantle his territories, or reorganize the hierarchy to recover your past subordinates or move him further down.

#ev_votesucc_2
Once a successor is elected, his position will be immediately swapped with [x] and he will inherit his rank and subordinates. The predecessor, by default, is automatically moved to the newly elected successor's previous position where he can then be further managed as a subordinate (dismantled, expelled, replaced...).

#ev_xplr_bdts
强盗伏击了我们的编队'[x]'!

#ev_xplr_bdts_1
While our formation '[x]' of [p2] Porcos was traveling through the wilderness, they happened at some point to pass through a small narrow pass nested between 2 hills. The sun was high and the Porcos were tired of the long journey and carrying of all the goods the troup had with them.

#ev_xplr_bdts_2
Unsurprisingly, a small group of about 20 ambushed bandits suddenly emerged on both sides, surrounding our troops. Their leader moved forwarded, and made a simple demand: "Give us all yerr loot or be bacon!". What should we do?

#ev_xplr_bdts_c1
"我们不怕没有猪匪!"

#ev_xplr_bdts_c2
给他们想要的。

#ev_xplr_abvil
'[x]'发现了一个废弃的村庄。

#ev_xplr_abvil_1
While exploring the lands, our group '[x]' stumbled upon the remains of an abonned primitive village of a few huts. Cautiously, the Porcos started to inspect these remains and came to the conclusion that whomever lived there are now long gone. "They seem to have abandonned many things here. Who knows for what reasons the people who lived there decided to leave, but they didnt take much with them!", concluded the group leader.

#ev_xplr_abvil_2
Although many things have spoiled or decayed with time, some still appear to be in good enough condition to be of interest to us. Should we search the village and scavenge what we can ?

#ev_xplr_abvil_c1
"是的，搜索这个被遗弃的村庄，让我们尽我们所能!"

#ev_xplr_abvil_c2
"不，我们就这样吧，我们没时间了。"

#ev_xplr_birds
无所畏惧的鸟类

#ev_xplr_birds_1
'[x]' were camping in a forest after a long day of walking in these unknown lands. Night was coming, and all the porcos were gathered around campfires. That's they heard a noise in a nearby bush, from which emerged a bunch of dumblooking fat birds unknown to them. The beasts seemed oblivious of their presence, picking on things on the forest floor as if they were alone on earth.

#ev_xplr_birds_2
"Well... Looks like fresh meat's back on the menu, boys!", grinned the group's leader: by morning, all the birds had went to meet their maker. What a lucky hunt! The group, in the morning, left with a fullbelly and a new stocks of fresh meat.

#ev_xplr_hsttrib
'[x]'被一个敌对的部落袭击了!

#ev_xplr_hsttrib_1
Bad news! While '[x]' was walking across new unknown lands, they suddenly found themselves surrounded by a group of a demi-dozen hostile natives. They came from nowhere... We probably stepped to close to their territory, or maybe they just don't like our snouts. Before the porcos could even realize what was happening, the primitive warriors was already attacking...

#ev_xplr_thirst
无情的沙漠

#ev_xplr_thirst_1
Our formation '[x]' wandered too far in unknown arid lands. For days, they could not find any source of fresh water. The porcos desperately searched for water, but it was no easy task in these desertic foreign lands. By the time they found a muddy puddle to quench their thrist, many of them had been lost to the vultures and the unforgiving sun of these lands.

#ev_xplr_thirst_2
Maybe we should have avoided venturing too far in such an hostile territory.  

#ev_xplr_lstjngl
迷失在丛林中

#ev_xplr_lstjngl_1
The porcos of '[x]' had been wondering in this bloody jungle for days, harassed by the heat and lost. It wasnt long before the one group turned into 2 groups... "Hey Mr Jenkins, I swear i already saw this damn tree 2 days ago!" said Porkypigs. "Common, maybe we'll find the rest of the group soon! Let's keep waking!". But they never did. However, they did find a nest of flesh eating flies the size of a hand when Mr Jenkins decided it was a good time to poke a suspicious hole in a tree with a stick in an attempt to find something to eat.

#ev_xplr_lstjngl_c1
"该死的詹金斯先生!" 

#ev_xplr_strvtrib
饥饿的部落

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_1
The porcos of '[x]' had spotted a small group of people away from them, walking on the side of a hill. The next day, in the morning, the same group was spotted again, this time closer, and the Porcos decided to go meet them: it was a small group of a few families, with piglets and sows, and they didnt seem to be of any threat.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_2
When moving closer, their condition became horrifyingly clear: these people were walking skelettons, starving. They walked slowly, and in their eyes was no hope. They didn't seem to notice the presence of the group getting closer to them until one of us stepped litteraly in front of them.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_3
We offered them some of our provisions, and it wasn't before the 2nd day that they finaly exchanged a few words with the group and told us their story. They used to be a bigger and prosperous tribe, living of hunting and gathering until they were chased away from their lands by a more powerful tribe. They had lost all their precious tools and weapons, and most of the strongest Porcos of their tribe had died fighting. Since then, the survivors had wandered the land unable to hunt, slowly starving.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_c1
"加入我们，我们将为您提供一个新家!"

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_c2
我们不能照顾这些人。让我们祝他们好运，然后继续前进。 

#ev_xplr_snakes
平原上的蛇

#ev_xplr_snakes_1
Our formation '[x]' was slowly crossing a seemingly endless plain covered in tall thick grass the height of a porco when one of them felt a sharp pain on his feet: he had been bitten by a colorfull snake that quickly disapeared in the grass. There was nothing we could do for the poor bastard: in a few minuts his leg had doubled volume and he met a gruesome death.

#ev_xplr_snakes_2
That, unfortunately, was just a begining as by the time the group managed to escape the plain, 2 more had been bitten and followed the same fate. This plain was litterally infested with viscious snakes.

#ev_xplr_snakes_c1
"我受够这些该死的蛇了!"

#ev_xplr_map
友好部落提供了该地区的'[x]'地图。

#ev_xplr_map_1
Our formation '[x]' was well received by natives in a small village, where they spent a few days to rest. The villagers offered our porcos to teach them all about the surrounding territory that they know very well: 

#ev_xplr_map_2
"Sniffingwind here is the village's best scout" said their chief. "He knows all the ins and outs of these lands. If you wish, Sniffingwind can show you how to travel in the territory, he's never been in trouble. He'll tell you what areas to avoid, what places are dangerous, and where to pass. In the meantime you're welcome to stay in our small village!" Should we stay a little more and accept their help?

#ev_xplr_snglost
探险家迷路了!

#ev_xplr_snglost_1
It is very dangerous to travel these unknown lands alone. Sadly, our explorer disapeared and was never heard of again. 

#ev_xplr_snglost_2
Who knows what happened to him... Maybe we should consider sending a bigger expedition next time, to increase our chances of success.

#ev_xplr_grplost
探险者迷失了!

#ev_xplr_grplost_1
It is very dangerous to travel these unknown lands in a small group. Sadly, our explorer disapeared and were never heard of again. 

#ev_xplr_grplost_2

#ev_xplr_storm
船只在一场可怕的风暴中沉没了!

#ev_xplr_storm_1
The sea is dangerous and moody. Before anyone had time to react, a calm breeze turned into a terrifying storm with waves taller than hills and a sky darker than the night. Our ship, sadly, was no match for this storm. The porcos fought bravely, but pigs and ships were all claimed by the sea by the next morning. I'm afraid we've lost the whole expedition.

#ev_xplr_rwave
惊涛骇浪!

#ev_xplr_rwave_1
The sea is dangerous and treacherous. It was a sunny day, the sea appeared to be calm and the breeze was nice. The porcos were relaxed, though eager to be back on land. But suddenly, one pig squeeled, pointing at horizon on starboard. Everyone looked in terror at what looked like an improbable wall of water coming in the direction of the ship. Before anyone could do anything, the tiny ship was hit and capsized. 

#ev_xplr_rwave_2
There was nothing they could have done against such a treacherous and unpredictible event: they did not stand a chance. Ship and pigs were dragged to tbe bottom of the sea, never to be seen again.

#ev_xplr_menlstsea
'[x]'遭遇到了暴风。

#ev_xplr_menlstsea_1
The sky had been threatening all evening: a wall of dark clouds coming from the horizon towards them. The captain tried to escape it, but unsucessfuly. It was too big, it moved too fast, and the ship was too tiny. They had to face it, and by nightfall, it had engulfed them.

#ev_xplr_menlstsea_2
It was a terrible night all the porcos will forever remember. Waves almost capsized the freil ship multiple times, but fortunately and against all odds, their loyal embarcation hanged on. Not everyone was there in the morning, and many porcos lost brothers that night. They will never mention it again, but all will remember forever the desperate calls for help of those who fell in the sea during the storm while they watched, helpless, as they drifted inexorably away from the ship.

#ev_xplr_invlstsea
'[x]'失去了海上补给。

#ev_xplr_invlstsea_1
One unskilled sailor didnt properly attach a crate of supplies the ship was carrying and during a turbulent night with strong winds, the crate fell into the sea and we lost its contents!

#ev_xplr_sngseal
危险的海

#ev_xplr_sngseal_1
The sea is no place for lone navigators. It is unforgiving and unmercyful: our few travellers disapeared and were never heard of again.

#ev_xplr_sngseal_2
Who knows what happened to them... Maybe we should consider sending a bigger expedition next time, if we want to stand a chance!

#ev_xplr_wiseold
聪明的Oldpig

#ev_xplr_wiseold_1
As our expedition '[x]' was heading to a new unexplored territory, a group of porcos in rags crossed our path. Despite their modest appearance, they all seemed well-educated, filled with assurance and determination. Their leader, a venerable oldpig wearing a shaggy beard falling to his knees, presented himself as a philosopher. He had been roaming the world for many years, professing his thought to anyone willing to listen.

#ev_xplr_wiseold_2
We decided to sit with them for a moment and the wise old pig started to present his doctrine: He argued that happiness couldn�t be reached by satisfying conventional desires like wealth, power, fame or pleasures of the flesh. According to his school of thought, only a simple life free from all possessions could really fulfill our souls. 

#ev_xplr_wiseold_3
He pleaded for hours, captivating the whole audience. His words were subtle and his reasoning logical. He was even so persuasive that many of us decided to give up all their possessions to follow him.

#ev_xplr_cptsow
被俘的母猪

#ev_xplr_cptsow_1
A scout of the expedition '[x]' just reported the presence of a band of warriors in the area. Judging by the appearance of their camp, their presence in the territory is just temporary. 

#ev_xplr_cptsow_2
In the center of their bivouac, the scout has spotted a large wooden cage filled with captive sows. We do not know the intentions of these warriors, nor the circumstances in which these sows were caught, but their fate seem quite unpleasant. 

#ev_xplr_cptsow_c1
与俘获者战斗，解放母猪。

#ev_xplr_cptsow_c2
不要牵扯进来。

#ev_xplr_slprats
该死的老鼠!

#ev_xplr_slprats_1
Our expedition, '[x]' was forced to take shelter in the first rocky cavity we could find as a thunderstorm suddenly broke out. Rain-soaked to the skin, we all clustered together and tried to rest despite the deafening noise of the tempest.

#ev_xplr_slprats_2
In the morning, the rain finally stopped and calm returned. Half asleep, we heard squeaks coming from our food containers. We soon realized we were surrounded by rats. The malicious rodents had taken advantage of the noise to feast on our provisions all night. 

#ev_xplr_jnglsnek
丛林里的蛇

#ev_xplr_jnglsnek_1
While '[x]' were making their way into the dense rainforest, one of our explorers was bitten by a jet-black snake. The creeping reptile then immediately vanished behind a bush. After a few hours, the injured porcos complained of feeling dizzy and having a blurred vision. He finally died in the night, unable to breathe.

#ev_xplr_lckyfsh_1
Our explorers of '[x]' were camping on the banks of a river for the night. It was a sunny late afternoon, and the water was crystal clear. That's when one porco spotted them: giant fat fishes swimming in the shallow waters! They were so slow the group could pick them up effortlessly.

#ev_xplr_lckyfsh_2
The group fed well that night. They also gutted and smoked a lot more fish to take with them on their journey.

#ev_xplr_natrprov
自然提供

#ev_xplr_natrprov_1
'[x]', while travelling across the land, stumbled upon a small patch of fertile land covered with lustrous plants filled with vegetables and fruits ready for the picking.

#ev_xplr_natrprov_2
Sometimes, the nature is generous and provides. The porcos stopped for a few hours and feasted with this unxpected gift and took the rest with them.

#ev_xplr_elegsow
The elegant sow

#ev_xplr_elegsow_1
During their journey through an unexplored territory, the expedition of '[x]' met a procession led by an elegant sow, comfortably seated on a palanquin. The two groups decided to travel together temporarily in order to benefit from mutual protection. 

#ev_xplr_elegsow_2
The porcos in the cortege barely spoke a word. Unlike the other members of her group, the matriarch was very dynamic and talkative. She said she was versed in the arts of botany and could prepare all kinds of miraculous remedies and ointments. When the time came for dinner, she served some of her specialties.  In order to wash it down, she also offered holy drinks concocted by her. Upon finishing the strange mixture, the explorers felt better than they had ever felt before. They thought the drink was blessed and that the mighty sow was of divine nature for being able to conceive such a substance. The following month, they were offered the holy mixture whenever they asked for it. They soon became addicted to the delicious drug of the Hag. They became her puppets, drained of all their wills, just like all the other unfortunate fellows in the procession.

#ev_xplr_elegsow_3
A few of them couldn�t stand it any longer and decided to flee during the night. The next days, they wandered aimlessly, struggling against the lack of drug. After a long and tough weaning they finally recovered. Just a few porcos of the former expedition party are still there. All the others have been bewitched by the extremely addictive concoction of the hag. 

#ev_xplr_mahout
看象人

#ev_xplr_mahout_1
During their peregrinations in unexplored lands, the porcos of  '[x]' halted in a small hamlet of peaceful mahouts. The locals owned a couple of healthy elephants. Taming these big creatures is a long and laborious process, and sometimes their wild instincts take control again. 

#ev_xplr_mahout_2
As our explorers were about to leave, the enormous pachyderms suddenly went berserk. They made a breach in the fence and brought chaos in the hamlet, grinding the huts, putting everything upside down. As the situation became desperate, one of our porcos approached carefully the two furious elephants. Against all odds, the enraged animals calmed down instantly. Lying down on their stomachs, they raised their trunks towards the porcos, in sign of prostration. The local population was stunned and thought our porcos was a divine being.  They all knelt in his direction and shouted: �The father of elephants!�

#ev_xplr_mahout_3
After that, the mahouts seemed to worship our porcos and wished to join us with their herd.

#ev_xplr_mahout_c1

#ev_xplr_luckstrk
鸿运当头

#ev_xplr_luckstrk_1
Our explorers '[x]' were ascending the steep slopes of a newly discovered territory when they started to feel the ground moving under their feet.  The piece of land on which the group was standing sharply broke away, causing a massive landslide. 

#ev_xplr_luckstrk_2
Many of our porcos were injured, but luckily all of them survived. As they got back on their feet, they noticed a shiny protuberance from afar.  As they approached it, they discovered an enormous deposit of ore, which had been laid bare by the landslide. 

#ev_xplr_ruinorph
幸存者孤儿

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_1
Our explorers '[x]' had spotted a large cloud of smoke on the horizon, rising and covering the sky of its dark coat. Our porcos cautiously approached the location from which the fire originated and discovered smoldering ruins, filled with the stench of death: lifeless bodies littered the ground all around, stripped of all valuables. Even the cattle had not been spared. 

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_2
Night was falling and the members of the expedition did not intend to spend more time in the middle of this macabre scene. As they were about to leave, their attention was caught by hundreds of small green lights taking off from a nearby bush: fireflies. Something had disrupted all these insects.

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_3
By searching more closely, our porcos found dozens of children hidden in the vegetation. They all looked very weak and desperate. They undoubtedly belonged to the village in ruins and their chances of survival seem very small if no help is given.

#ev_xplr_sick_1
Many porcos in the expedition '[x]' have contracted a fever. The disease doesnt seem to heal and even got worse day after day. The sick porcos are struck by hallucinations and delusions. They sweat profusely and can no longer walk with the rest of the expedition party. 

#ev_xplr_sick_2
The valid members of our expedition have to make a choice: either set camp for a while in the vicinity to feed the sick and hope that they'll recover, or leave without them.

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_1
The porcos '[x]' were exploring the coast of unknowned lands when they found various pieces of a recent ship wreck brought back on the shore by the tide. A little further away, they found the bodies of its unfortunate sailors lying down on the beach. 

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_2
Most of them had drowned but some porcos could still breathe: with some food and rest, the survivors could be put back on their feet.

醉醺醺的傻瓜

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_1
Our expedition '[x]' encountered a small nomadic tribe. The members of this tribe were very kind and welcoming. Never had our explorers met such friendly fellows. 

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_2
After a few pleasant days in their company, our porcos finally had to leave, and a ceremony was held in their honor the day before their departure. For the occasion, the nomads brought out a majestic statue of their idol: A squatting porco with two heads: one of wood and the other of gold.

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_3
During the festivities, one of our porcos, emboldened by alcohol, beheaded the golden head of the statue. This sparked great outrage from the tribe and the thief was immediately attached and condemned to death for this great sacrilege.

#ev_xplr_mourn
丧族 - 哀悼部落

#ev_xplr_mourn_1
Our explorers of '[x]' were exploring new lands when they encountered a dozen of mourning porcos, burying a sow and a piglet. After a poignant funeral, they told our porcos that they formerly belonged to a much larger group that had been slowly decimated by multiple bandit attacks and epidemics. They were running out of supplies now and had lost all hope of salvation.

亚马逊女战士!

#ev_xplr_amazn_1
While exploring a dense tropical forest, our porcos '[x]' heard an enchanting melody. As they approached the location from which the music came from, they discovered a magnificent sow sitting at the edge of a pond, languorously sliding her fingers between the strings of a wooden harp. The explorers were captivated by so much beauty and lowered their guards.

#ev_xplr_amazn_2
After finishing her song, the sow delicately stood up, grabbed a short bow and shot an arrow in the direction of the explorers, accompanied by other warrior maidens who had sprung everywhere around them. 

#ev_xplr_amazn_c1
"我以为亚马逊女战士是一个传说，保护你们自己!"

#ev_xplr_egg
好奇的猪

#ev_xplr_egg_1
Our explorers of '[x]' stumbled upon an abandonned nest containing a few large eggs: enough to make a juicy omelet. One curious hog decided to keep his egg , depriving himself of  the tasty meal. During days he carried it around, and he slept next to it at nights. This went on for dozens of days, attracting him mockery from his companions. 

#ev_xplr_egg_2
One morning, under the curious hog's scrutiny, the egg hatched and from it emerged a tiny fluffy ostrich. Since then, its been following its benefactor everywhere he goes and the rest of the group even came to consider the bird as their troop's mascott.

#ev_xplr_orphel
孤立的小象

#ev_xplr_orphel_1
Our explorers of '[x]' had been marching for hours under the sun of arid lands when they heard weird calling noises that seemed desperate. They walked to a deep muddy hole at the bottom of which was stuck a young pachyderm calf and her mother. While the little elephant was alive, the other was no longer. 

#ev_xplr_orphel_2
By cutting branches from dead trees nearby, the group worked tiredlessly for a few hours to dig and help the calf out of the hole. As soon as it got out, the scared animal first ran away. But grateful and having nowhere else to go, the little pachyderm apparently took a liking of the group and started folowing them ever since. First at at a respectful distance, and everyday closer until it ended up marching right in the middle of their group and sleeping next to their camp at nights.

#ev_xplr_tribrem_1
Our explorers of '[x]' stumbled upon the remains of an unfortunate small group of nomads. By the looks of it, they had died a long time ago in circumstances the group couldn't figure out. All their belongings appeared to be still intact next to them.

#ev_xplr_tribrem_c1

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs
被遗弃的幼崽

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs_1
Our explorers of '[x]' where caught by a violent storm and took refuge in a small cavern under a nearby cliff to wait it out. While they were busy setting camp in it, they heard strange calling noises. 

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs_2
Grabbing a torch, one Porco went in the back to investigate and discovered 3 distressed wolf cubs. They looked dirty and hungry, visibly abandonned for quite a while : this was no regular wolf den and there was no sign of any wolves nearby. Noone knew how these 3 cubs ended up here, but the group decided to adopt them. The young wolves quickly got back in shape and it wasnt long until they became loyal companions apreciated by the whole group. Well, all except for the old Clawhog whose entire family was tragically devoured by wolves when he was just a piglet. 

#ev_xplr_wolves
森林中的野兽

#ev_xplr_wolves_1
Our explorers of '[x]' where travelling through a dense forest when at dusk, they started to feel uneasy and watched. They kept progressing in silence, nervous, while dark silhouettes seemed to follow and encircle them. 

#ev_xplr_wolves_2
Suddently, a terrifying growl came from the front, stopping the group. "Wolves i tell ya!", said the old Clawhop who didn't like these beasts -to say the least- as everyone on the group knew. "Get yerr weapons ready, pigs!", he added as several growls echoed around them. From all sides they emerged, ugly bacon-eating canines.

#ev_xplr_bears
熊!

#ev_xplr_bears_1
Our explorers of '[x]' had setup camp in unknown lands for the night when, at dawn, they woke up to unusual rumpus. Horrified, they saw a group of 3 huge bears scavenging through their inventory and supplies lying next to the camp.

#ev_xplr_bears_2
One of the porcos sleeping close to where the bears were, startled by this realization, made a move which had the unfortunate consequence of calling the attention of one of the beasts. The animal, angry and hungry, ran up to the poor bastard and decided it was time for a bacon breakfast.

#ev_xplr_blizzard
恶性暴风雪

#ev_xplr_blizzard_1
A viscious blizzard immobolized our expedition of '[x]' for many days. Many of them did not make it while the survivors consummed all the remaining food supplies. There is nothing to eat in these bleak lands!

#ev_xplr_icehole
该死的冰洞!

#ev_xplr_icehole_1
These lands are treacherous. While progressing on a difficult terrain, a few porcos of our expendition '[x]' fell to their death as ice broke under them, revealing a deep sink hole.

#ev_xplr_avlch

#ev_xplr_avlch_1
As our group was travelling in a difficult terrain, a sudden avalanche took half of our people and supplies! What are we even doing there?!

#ev_xplr_freez1
冰川之夜

#ev_xplr_freez1_1
Travelling in such a glacial weather requires constant supplies, including wood to keep fires alive in the camp during nights. Good thing our expedition of '[x]' still had some wood to survive a particularly glacial night.

#ev_xplr_freez2

#ev_xplr_freez2_1
After a particularly glacial night, having nothing to keep themselves warm,  many of members of the '[x]' expedition fell asleep never to wake up again.

#ev_xplr_polfood1

#ev_xplr_polfood1_1
Travelling in freezing hostile barren lands requires constant supplies, including food, as often there is absolutely nothing to eat in this icy desert. Good thing our expedition of '[x]' still had some food supplies to survive another day.

#ev_xplr_polfood2

#ev_xplr_polfood2_1
Sadly, now out of food supplies and unable to find anything to eat in these dreadful lands, our starving expedition '[x]' disapeared into this glacial white unforgiving desert and where never heard of again.

#ev_spwn_succ
继承权

#ev_spwn_succ_1
[x] of the [y] has left his position after many years of service. You have been named as successor and have now inherited control of all the possessions and duties of the [y].

#ev_spwn_succ_2
You have taken over a character that became inactive for remaining unplayed for too long by its previous owner. You are therefore picking up where it was left. You inhertied all its regions, units, diplomatic relations and knowledges, and you might be part of an existing Nation. 

#ev_spwn_newld
新的领导

#ev_spwn_newld_1
The region of [x], in need of new leadership, has chosen you for the task. 

#ev_spwn_newld_2
You have taken over a previously leader-less region, either because it was abandonned by its previous owner or because its people rebelled against him. You are therefore a new free and independent sovereign entity free of all treaties, starting with a single region. Your starting knowledges are inherited from the pre-existing buildings in the region. Be weary: you might face the hostility of your region's previous owner if he's still around.

#ev_spwn_clny
领导殖民地

#ev_spwn_clny_1
After many years of slow development and quiet leadership from obedient administrators, the colony of [x] attached to the [y] is now ready to become a political entity of its own. You have gained their trust and been promoted to become the first true leader of [x] as the region is awarded a new administrative and political status within the [p1], under the patronnage of the [y]. Its is time for [x] to make a name for itself and leave its mark in the history of Porcokind. 

#ev_spwn_clny_2
You have become the first ruler of a colony previously founded by another player. This region is therefore now evolving and becoming its own political entity ruled by you. However you start as a member of an existing Nation, and by default under the patronnage of the colony's original founder: the [y]. As a new branch of his culture, you also start with all the knowledges of the founders. As an ex-colony, be warned that you also start with a treaty binding you to his Nation, meaning you wont be able to leave it without breaking it and suffering penalties or even war. But this can also be a good thing: you are not starting alone and can seek protection and help from your superiors in the Nation, helping your development. It is probably a wise idea to start by reaching out to your superior and founder to greet him and establish friendly relations. Then who knows, maybe one day it will be time for [x] to claim its independance!

#ev_clnyevlv
一个殖民地进化了!

#ev_clnyevlv_1
Good news! One of our colonies, [x], has found its first proper ruler: [p1]. They have established their own new government and are now known as the [p2]. 

#ev_clnyevlv_2
They have integrated our great nation as one of our subordinates and formally ratified the colonial treaty binding them to us and agreeing to a tax of 5% of their incomes in addition to the duties of their new title in the nation. 

#ev_clnyevlv_3
As insurance, we will maintain control of their treasury of over 50% of their GDP in case they ever decide to illegally break this agreement!

#ev_form_ovrdrft
'[y]'的家人口不足!

#ev_form_ovrdrft_1
The population of [x], home of our formation '[y]', is insufficient to maintain this formation! There isn't enough new young adult porcos to replace the ones aging and because of this we will be unable to maintain its current headcount and the formation will gradually lose units until this is fixed.

#ev_form_desertion
我们的士兵正在当逃兵!

#ev_form_desertion_1
The soldiers in our armies are deserting because of your negative Legitimacy! People do not wish to serve a ruler they no longer consider legitimate and we'll keep seeing Porcos leaving our ranks everyday until your legitimacy is positive again.

#ev_form_ovrdrft_2
Maybe we should consider downsizing to reduce the population over-draft in [x], or we could relocate this formation to another territory that could support them better. If we don't act, this formation will slowly decay!

#ev_xplr_brkleg
