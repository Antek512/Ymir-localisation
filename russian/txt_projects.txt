#idea_ptry
Корзины из грязи

#idea_ptry1_1
Один поросенок, играя в грязи, заметил особый сорт податливой грязи, высохшей на солнце и начал с ней играть. Его мать плела корзины для племени. К сожалению, ее корзины не были лучшими из лучших, и собиратели часто жаловались на их грубое плетение: злаки часто просыпались, а крысы воровали то, что осталось.

#idea_ptry1_2
Увидев покрытого грязью сына, когда тот вернулся домой, она придумала покрыть одну из корзин грязью и дать ей высохнуть на солнце.Это должно было сделать ее непроницаемой и прекратить жалобы собирателей..

#idea_ptry1_3
К сожалению, корзина должно не продержалась. Грязь быстро растрескалась и отвалилась от каркаса корзины. Свиноматка просит, чтобы несколько членов племени пошли и набрали ей еще этой грязи. Также ей нужно время, чтобы сделать больше этих особых корзин. Рядом с костром по ночам часто жарче, чем на солнце в самый жаркий летний полдень. Они думает, что нам стоит попробовать разместить эту особую грязь рядом с большим костром, чтобы она высыхала быстрее и сильнее.

#proj_ptry1_1
Давайте попробуем делать корзины из глины, и выясним, как сушить их так, чтобы они не разваливались через несколько дней.

#proj_ptry1_2
Эти корзины можно делать гораздо быстрее и проще. Они более герметичные, чем плетеные и помогут племени хранить всякую всячину!

#proj_ptry1_3
Нам нужно, чтобы члены племени набрали этой особой грязи и научились придавать ей форму корзин, а затем, как обжигать их, чтобы они становились прочнее.

#idea_sedent
Оседлая жизнь

#idea_sedent_1
Однажды вечером, когда все племя собралось у костра, Груки-Лениворыл произнес: 

#idea_sedent_2
 "Здесь у нас есть все, что нужно! Что, если мы перестанем кочевать, как древние, и останемся здесь жить? Я устал собирать, а потом устанавливать эти палатки каждый день! Оставаясь на одном месте, мы смогли бы накопить больше инструментов и вещей, не тревожась, что все это потом придется куда-то нести!"

#proj_sedent_1
Что, если мы решим осесть на этом месте? Мы смогли бы накопить больше вещей и больше орудий, не беспокоясь каждый раз, когда мы кочуем, что нам не хватит рук унести все это!

#idea_prprt
Это мое

#idea_prprt_1
Племя растет и, с тех пор как мы решили осесть, у нас появилось много вещей и инструментов: гораздо больше, чем имели предки в своей кочевой жизни! Удивительно,но это изобилие, похоже, вызывает между нами напряженность. Некоторые свины, тратящие много времени на изготовление вещей возмущаются от необходимости делиться ими с теми, кто по их мнению работает гораздо меньше.

#idea_prprt_2
Один свин предлагает договориться, чтобы никто не брал вещи у других семей без разрешения. Странное предложение... но такие уж странные времена настали. 

#proj_prprt_1
Многие члены племени недовольны необходимостью делиться всеми своими вещами друг с другом и это создает напряженность.

#proj_prprt_2
Чтобы разрешить эти конфликты, мы могли бы убедить все семьи племени следовать простому правилу: члены одной семьи больше не могут брать вещи у другой семьи без разрешения.

#idea_eldcncl
Решение конфликтов

#idea_eldcncl_1
Все в племени знают Шнаппи Шнапса, старшего сына из рода Бужениновых. Тупой как пробка и ни на что не годный... но никто не может отрицать великолепие его длинных клыков. Вскоре Гертруда, младшая свинка из рода Трутис, подпала под его чары, что сильно расстроило ее батюшку, и он отказался от свадьбы, не смотря на дары, предложенные старейшинами Бужениновых.

#idea_eldcncl_2
Напряженность росла и конфликт угрожал единству племени. Что если избрать не замешанных в конфликте свинов, которые решат как уладить эту ситуацию?

#proj_eldcncl_1
Большинства конфликтов можно было бы избежать, если старейшины каждой семьи племени чаще общались друг с другом, ведь они мудры и пользуются всеобщим уважением. Кроме того это позволит им заняться чем-то еще, кроме воспитания поросят...

#proj_eldcncl_2
Если удастся убедить их разговаривать друг с другом, что будет не просто, то можно будет построить для них специальную большую хижину, где они смогут встречаться и обсуждать проблемы племени. Уверен, что племя подчинится их решениям и суждениям.

#idea_privl
I deserve retribution!

#idea_privl_1
The tribe is growing and as its dominant leader you now spend a lot of your time managing things and discussing matters of the tribe, with less and less time to participate in lower tasks and work like any other tribespig.

#idea_privl_2
And what would the tribe become without your benevolent work ? Don't you deserve to be rewarded and assisted for your hard work ? And how can you earn the respect of the tribe if you just appear to be their equal ? Then some will always try to contest your legitimacy as a ruler!

#proj_privl_1
Displaying wealth would be a good way to impress and gain dominance on possible rivals, showing  to everyone that you are fit to rule them because you are not like anyone else: you are their superior. 

#proj_privl_2
Yes, they should all aknowledge your superiority by giving  you a share of their wealth! Now though, the rest of the tribe remains to be convinced of this groundbreaking concept...

#idea_lead
One Porco to rule them all

#idea_lead_1
All these talks to try convincing everyone of the tribe to do anything are just taking too long. Too much talking, too much negociating, too much time wasted. Some are more worthy to rule than others, anyways... And it should be you, of course, you just know it! All you could do if you weren't slowed down by having to convince everyone else every time... It was fine before, but now the village has grown and there's just too many people. 

#proj_lead_1
Its time for the tribe to be lead by a single Porco. One pig to rule them all, without all the talking and negociating and convincing everyone to do anything. But this will not be easy, and all the other key members of the village must give their support, be submitted or be eliminated. Then, finally, only you will control the fate of the tribe!

#idea_gov
Organizing the power

#idea_gov_1
We are no longer a small tribe: our society has grown more and more complex, with always more people and more things to manage and maintain... While a single leader can no longer attend to all the issues and matters that require attention and know all the skills, on the other hand projects that affect the whole society such as maintaining expensive common structures  cannot be dealt with by independent individuals on their own and require a common organization.

#idea_gov_2
Maybe its time to reorganize and formalize the leadership of our people, and to learn how to delegate tasks to better manage everything: what if we created a new kind of class of Porcos assisting the leader, with officialy as their only occupation to manage issues in his name ?

#proj_gov_1
We could reorganize the leadership of our society by having new delegates with an official status, acting under the instructions and mandate of our leader: a hierarchy of porcos responsible of different aspects of our society, instead of having the leader personnaly attend to all issues.

#proj_gov_2
They could all work in a single big impressive building in the middle of our village made for this sole purpose, to reinforce your legitimacy. With this, we would be able to manage much more easily our growing society and people.

#idea_guard
Стражники

#idea_guard_1
Who is going to ensure everyone pays their due ? Who is going to go shake the sows and piglets so that a stubborn Porco reveals the precious wares he was hidding burried under his hut's floor and refusing to pay as tribute to your highness ? 

#idea_guard_2
Surely the officials of the government shouldnt belittle themselves in doing such tasks. Plus most of them are not exactly in shape to impress hardened peasants... However what if we used some of these tributes to pay strong Porcos of to escort the officials and do the dirty work? The people would think twice before contesting our authority!

#proj_guard_1
Lets create and organize a new cast directly dependent on the goverment: guards, a new kind of warriors that would protect the government not against foreign ennemies but against our own population. They would protect officals and patrol the city everyday, reinforcing our authority on the population. 

#idea_tribut
Tributes

#idea_tribut_1
Instead of relying on voluntary contributions from the people, its time to set rules and force everyone to give their share for the common good of everyone... to us in the government of course.

Мы могли бы начать обменивать товары эквивалентной стоимости за каждую услугу, вместо того, чтобы делиться всем с общиной в надежде потом получить что-то в ответ, что становится сложнее отслеживать с ростом населения. Экономика подарков работает только до тех пор, пока все члены общины знают и доверяют друг другу. В противном случае это создает конфликты и нестабильность, которые можно снизить перейдя к системе моментального эквивалентного обмена.

#idea_currcy

#idea_currcy_1
We could try to select common goods that are small, durable and rare enough to use as standards for exchanges: anyone could exchange their goods to one of these knowing they can then trade it back against other necessities. That would facilitate trading, not having to find goods needed by both parties and beeing able to measure and store values more efficiently.

The post and lintel construction technique has its limits: there's only so much weight a beam can withstand before breaking. What if we could redirect weight on the sides to improve this, by stacking beams of increasing lenght on top of each other until the cover the space between the pillars ?

Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of stone to counteract the effects of gravity, but what if we could master a way to create new arches so light they could stand on simple columns by redirecting weight into its supporting pillars ? We could construct things bigger, taller and more spacious than anything we've ever built before.

Metals become soft and maleable when heated in large fires. The hotter, the more maleable and soft they seem to become... So what if we improved our furnaces to heat them so much they would become temporarly as liquid as fresh water? We could litteraly pour the metal into holes with the desired shape right away instead of having to work it with manual hammering. If we can master this technique, that would allow us to mass produce items and weapons at a much higher speed and with a much more consistent quality!

However making bronze out of Copper and the rarer Tin is a complicated process that makes us rely on 2 different metals and dependent on trade. Maybe this new metal, while harder to extract, could be an alternative to Bronze?

#idea_fineryforg
Working with cast iron

#idea_fineryforg_1
Iron is a capricious metal hard to work with. If you heat it just enough to soften, with a lot of manual forging you can work it into a maleable but flexible soft metal. However if you melt it completely to the point of casting it, it becomes very hard but brittle and impossible to work with! Blast furnaces are very efficient and fast but they are so efficient they only produce this cast iron we do not know how to work with properly... Heating and hammering it for a long time allows to slowly remove the carbon, eventually producing pure 'rough iron'. Using our knowledges of mechanics, we could try to create special forges making this operation much more faster and efficient, allowing us to streamline iron production out of cast iron ingots we can already mass produce with bast furnaces.

It appears that iron heated in contact with charcoal gets stronger but also more brittle. Too much of it and it becomes useless... But if we were to master the art of dosing and it properly and a process of how to apply it to iron, we could produce a metal far superior than everything we've ever seen so far: steel, at the right balance between flexibility and resistance.

#idea_decarb
From cast iron to steel

#idea_decarb_1
Cast Iron isn't really usefull by itself: it's very strong but also very brittle and you cannot work with it. We can produce it easily but its saturated with carbon... Meanwhile, steel is also iron, but with less carbon in it. Currenlty we are making steel by taking pure iron and adding carbon to it with charcoal but its slower to produce and requires a lot of manual forging to produce while Cast Iron can be mass produced with blast furnaces. Therefore it would make steel production much easier if we could master a way to make steel out of Cast Iron by removing the extra carbon instead of making it by adding carbon to pure iron.

#idea_agrcultr_1
Our people is starving! Our hunters and gatherers do not manage to bring enough food for everyone anymore, and we quickly need to find a solution if we want the tribe to keep prospering. Urged by this situation, a young gatherer came forward and proposed something mind shattering to the elders of the tribe : why not make our own plants ? 

#idea_agrcultr_2
He explained how a few weeks ago, one of his piglets dropped a basket full of precious grain harvested in the morning in muddy soil near his hut, and how they could only recover some of it. He brought them to the same patch of mud, from which now stood a few fresh and green plants bearing the same grain. "If we cannot find enough plants to feed everyone anymore, then let us make our own!" he said. 

#proj_agrcultr_1

To do this, one pocro proposes to create a large patch of mud near the village and sacrifice some of our harvested foods to burry it in that ground, claiming this will bring new plants we can harvest later! But how long will this take ? How much work ? Can we afford to sacrifice food for such a foolish enterprise ?

Who needed that anyway ? For there was enough food freely available at hand and no need to bother with extra work. Maybe now is the time to show interest in his ideas, so our tribe can keep growing bigger ?

Crafting skins of vegetals

#idea_weaving_1
Sometimes peeling tree barks or long grass gives you long strips of vegetables that can be dried and woven into baskets and other things by the craftmen of the tribe. But these are usually hard and rough. Yet some of them compete to always produce the finest weaving with the softest thread, experimenting with new techniques and new materials. What if they managed to make a material thin, flexible and light enough to use instead of the smelly leather hides we use for clothing?

Weaving bigger textiles

#idea_loom5_1
The 'shuttle' is a piece of the loom that needs to go from one side of the textile to the other constantly. Its a fastidious and tiring operation for the weaver, requiring to constantly bend over the machine to move the shuttle, and it limits the size of the woven textile to his arm's lenght or it requires complex coordination between multiple workers. If we could find a way to improve this process with mechanics, it could greatly improve the productivity of our textile industries and the working conditions of our weavers.

Animal hides are smelly and they decay, harden, and rot pretty quickly. We need to find ways to improve their durability by preventing their putrefaction. To do that we should master the proper way to clean and process the hides: removing hair, scrapping all the leftover flesh, and drying them with smoke and sun in the same way we smoke meat to make it last longer.

Removing the hair out of the hides is a really labor intensive process that requires a lot of time but is necessary to process the hides into more durable leather. But some tanners with questionnable hobbies advanced that by using urine and soaking the hides for a long time in it makes the hair removing much easier afterwards. This nasty process could greatly improve the efficiency of our tanneries, but its definilty not going to improve the problem of their pestilence...

Using tannins

#idea_vegettan_1
One autumn, a busy and inexperienced tanner had left and forgotten a stack of cleaned hides outside near his house, under a grove of trees. The hides remained there for weeks and hadn't been properly packed: they soaked with water from the humid ground and constant rains of autumn, covered and surrounded by fallen twigs and leaves from the nearby trees. When the tanner realized his mistake, he was quite surprised to find the hides in such good condition: not only had they resisted putrefaction from the humidity, but they looked more flexible than the ones usually processed through drying and smoking. What was the cause of this miracle? Looking at the brown water from the decaying leaves and wood in which the hides had soaked all that time, the tanner felt he already knew the answer to that.

#proj_vegettan_1
It seems that by soaking hides for a long time in baths of diluted vegetables and wood, we could improve their flexibility and resistance to humidity, increasing their durability and replacing the older less efficient process of letting them rot and smoking them.

One day, a Porco left a few leftover grains in a pot outside of his hut. Forgotten, they remained there for days under the rain. Later, while cleaning stuff around his hut, the Porco happened to cover the pot by stacking other baskets on top of it without noticing its content. When he eventually rediscovered the pot, from its content came a strange somewhat appealing smell. Curious by nature, the hog tasted the drink and felt funny afterwards.

They claim such armor, even by itself, could prove far more efficient than expected while only using cheap materials. It could also be used in addition to other types of armor worn above it.

Clothes of metal

#idea_scalearm_1
Metal is hard and resistent. What if our warrior could wear clothes made of metal to resist enemy blows? Unfortunately its not exactly flexible like cloth... What if, like the scales of the fish, we made a metallic skin made of small scales covering each other, still allowing its wearer to move while beeing heavily protected?

A coat of plates

#idea_brigdn_1
Scale armors are vulnerable to piercing attacks and upward blows. Despite a slight loss of flexibility, what if instead of having visible scales on top of each other we designed an armor where the scales are sewn indepently to a padded leather cloth and covered by another layer of fabric to hide them, making the whole more resistant to piercing thanks to the leather and the impossibility to slip the point of a weaping through gaps between scales?

Unpiercable coat

#idea_chnmail_1
All armors remain weak against piercing blows: the finest weaponsmiths propose to craft a fine cloth of tiny metal rings which, linked together, would form an unpiercable coat that could be worn beneath other armors to protect against arrows and thrusting attacks. Such an armor would be expensive and really time consuming, requiring the best craftsmanship and metal, probably reserved to elite troops.

Wearing plates of hard metal

#idea_cuirass_1
A warrior with a skin of metal would be undefeatable for sure. And metal can be shaped into anything we want. However its not flexible... But we could still use it as a breastplate protecting most of the body from enemy weapons, although it would be heavy and reduce the dexterity of the warrior wearing it, it could save his life more than once!

Металлические шапки

#idea_lhelmet_1
Самые опасные удары для воинов - удары в голову. Используя знания металлургии мы можем придать металлу любую форму, какую захотим. Нам стоит сделать шапки из металла, которые серьезно улучшат защиту наших воинов.

#idea_hvhelmet_1
Почему бы не закрыть нашими шлемами всю морду и голову по бокам? Конечно, это ограничит поле зрения воинов, но выглядеть будет здорово. Это также улучшит их броню...

The sow and the elephant

#idea_elephrid_1
In one small paddock was kept an elephant, a mighty beast captured from the wilderness and now kept in captivity as livestock or maybe just by curiosity. Most people were afraid to approach but every day a lonely young sow would go to the beast to feed him with fresh vegetables, fascinated by its magesty. To her the animal didn't look feriocious: she saw intelligence and sadness in its eyes. As time passed, she built trust with the elephant who would wait for her and greet her with her trunk when she arrived.

#idea_elephrid_2
One night, she decided to free the elephant from its paddock: the animal fled and the sow felt happy. Months passed and the turmoils of this event faded... Later, as she was wandering in the woods after a heavy storm, she fell into a mud hole and got stuck under a fallen tree trunk. For many hours she called for help. But noone ever came... not even the elephant which, unbeknownst to all, was in fact lying dead in a ditch not far away after getting stuck in a mud hole as well. But this tragic story gave another porco some thoughs: first that mud holes are dangerous. And then that surely if an elephant had happened to be there he could have easily pulled that trunk to save the sow... if only the one they had hadn't escaped a few weeks before!

Taming pachyderms

#proj_elephrid_1
These huge pachyderm beasts have the strenght of 50 hogs. They also seem to be pretty clever: what if we could find a way to tame them and work with them? Imagine the rampage such mighty animals could do into battles if they accepted to fight among us! They surely look strong enough to carry and push heavy weights. Maybe they could even carry people on their backs... It's worth trying!

#idea_obsidn
Блестящие черные камни

#idea_obsidn_1
Оружейники племени заметили, что этот особый, блестящий черный камень, названный обсидианом гораздо лучше обычного кремня. Когда он раскалывается, то получившаяся кромка выходит острее всего, что они видели, и может разрезать что угодно. Что если мы сделаем с помощью него оружие? Обычно эти камни малы, но один ремеслосвин предложил: что, если мы вставим несколько из них в деревянную палку, чтобы получить длинное непрерывное лезвие той формы, какой мы пожелаем?

#proj_obsidn_1
Обсидиан - это вулканическое стекло. С ним легко работать и он очень твердый. Его можно расколоть, получив чрезвычайно острый сколы, которые можно использовать в изготовлении оружия острее, чем все что делается из обычного кремня. Мы могли бы потратить время и ресурсы, чтобы люди нашего племени овладели навыком его обработки и научились из него оружие.
